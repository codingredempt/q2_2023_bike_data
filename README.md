# q2_2023_bike_data

##
Hello there I am doing this as part of my Google Data Analytics Course. After working with different programs to get eveything set for the analyis of the data. I am posting my findings here.
##
# Question I was asked to answer
I was asked to find "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" Here is what I found.
# Findings
After analizing the data I found that most Members of the Cyclist subscription used the bike for an average length of 12.5 minutes while the casual people that used it averaged around 27 minutes. Members used the bikes more often then causal members on a day to day basis, with the busiest day being Satuday.

# Tools I used to get this data cleaned and presentable
I used Excel to modify the data set and clean, by getting rid of unnessicary data and renaming columns for easier understanding.
I used R to combine the data set together and then uploaded to Tablau for visuals
